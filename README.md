## ðŸ‘€ About Vision-SR1

Vision-SR1 is a self-rewarded RL training framework to decompose VLMs' language reasoning into visual perception reasoning and language reasoning. Inspired by the awesome works of e.g. Vision-R1, Visionary-R1, R1-VL, we leverage VLM's self evolving and reasoning ability to **Reward Itself**. 

Because VLMs fuse the vision encoder with the LLM backbone only late in pretraining, they often rely primarily on language reasoning rather than visual perception. Standard RL training tends to **recall prior language knowledge** for accuracy gains while **neglecting vision**. External LLM-based perception rewards can help but introduce bias and heavy latency. We instead propose a self-reward framework, enabling the model to provide its own visual and reasoning feedback with **no latency**.

Besides vision decomposition, We constructed two datasets: **Vsion-SR1-Cold-9K** for SFT and **Vision-SR1-47K** for RL.
